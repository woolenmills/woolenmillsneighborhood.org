Dear Neighbors,

I’ve lived in and around Charlottesville since 1972 and in 2003 I moved to my house at 18●● Chesapeake. So, for the last 16 years I’ve benefited from the time, patience and hard work of the many members of the Woolen Mills Neighborhood Association Board, and I feel it’s my turn to serve my neighborhood. I’ve appreciated the vigilance with which our board has engaged the city and developers, and I’ve admired the outreach efforts that have happened in different ways over the years. I would look forward to joining the current board and other new board members, in facing what challenges and opportunities lie ahead.

Annie Stafford\
