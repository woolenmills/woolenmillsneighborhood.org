**Potluck:** As a reminder, the WMNA will provide hot dogs & veggie dogs and non-alcoholic beverages. Firefly, Ting, and Grit will all be bringing some treats as well. Please bring a side dish or a snack to share. City Council candidates will also be stopping by.

We encourage families to dress their kids in their best Halloween costumes for a contest! We will also have other fun fall activities.
