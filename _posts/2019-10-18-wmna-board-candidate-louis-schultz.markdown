Since the deadline to submit declarations of candidacy has unexpectedly been extended an additional 6 hours I’d like to withdraw what I submitted earlier and replace it with this. Please forward this to the list.

Neighbors,

Something important has happened and I’d like to amend my Declaration of WMNA Board Candidacy.

On Wednesday Sept. 25, 2019 at 7:20 AM an email under the header “WMNA Election & Annual Meeting: 10/27 4-7 PM in the Chapel” was sent by the WMNA board encouraging neighborhood residents over the age of 18 to declare an interest in seeking election to open seats on the board.

It said – “Declarations of candidacy may be made anytime between **now and October 17th at 6:00 PM.**” The emphasis was in the original.

Just 3 days ago on Monday Oct. 14, 2019 at 9:00 AM a reminder email was sent under the header “WMNA Fall Social & Election; Sunday, 10/27 4-7 PM in the Chapel.”

It also said – “Declarations of candidacy may be made anytime between **now and October 17th at 6:00 PM.**” Again the emphasis was in the original.

Now, following the declaration of my candidacy under the rules as they have twice been clearly stated by the board, those rules have changed in the same way rules were changed after the fact to keep me off the board following my election to it in October of 2018.

An organization which is represented by a board which pays no attention to the rules by which it constituted is one that is in serious trouble and I can’t think of a better illustration of the lack of accountability I spoke of in my original declaration than what has happened since I made it little more than an hour ago.

If the WMNA is to survive, a lot must change. I plan to be an agent of change.

Neighbors,

I’d like to declare my candidacy for the WMNA board. There are numerous issues I’d like to address as a board member, but I’ll select two to highlight. Those are my concerns about the future of the Woolen Mills Chapel and the accountability (or lack thereof) of the WMNA board to the greater Woolen Mills Neighborhood.

THE CHAPEL

The Woolen Mils Chapel at the corner of Riverside and East Market is one of the few buildings in the controversial “conservation district” that actually merits protection due to its architectural features and association with the neighborhood’s namesake mill.

The chapel has suffered significant damage due to long term neglect and it urgently needs restoration. The already high costs of doing that will only continue to rise the longer repairs are delayed.

The building’s stone foundation is badly deteriorated, particularly the North East corner, and the wooden sill along the sidewalk on East Market Street is obviously badly rotted. The bell tower is in need of major structural work. The concrete sidewalk will need to be removed so that proper drainage can be installed. Much more needs to be done.

The chapel’s problem have been compounded by the fact that no one actually knows who owns the building. For more than a decade, members of the WMNA board have been aware of the questions surrounding the ownership of the chapel as well as concerns about the condition of the building itself.

A conspiracy of silence among past board members about both the building’s legal situation and its physical condition has kept most neighbors in the dark about both issues.

An attempt by board members about 10 years ago to secretly claim ownership of the property through a nonprofit they controlled failed and virtually nothing has been done to even stabilize the situation since.

We have a wealth of talent and interest in the preservation of history in the greater Woolen Mills Neighborhood and it has not been mobilized in an effort to save the building due to the board’s secrecy. Hundreds of thousands of dollars will need to be raised to do a proper restoration.

Since income from the church that rents the chapel building is far from sufficient to pay for its upkeep, a long term plan needs to be developed to make the building self supporting. Whatever use might be found to produce income will inevitably impact the neighborhood which must begin to have a say in what future we want for our most iconic building.

BOARD ACCOUNTABILITY

I was elected to the WMNA board at the last election under the rules that were in operation at the time of that election. I have been improperly kept from the seat I was elected to by a change to the rules AFTER I was elected.

The sole purpose of the ex-post-facto rule change was that the outgoing board president wanted to keep me off of the board. Two members of the current (3 member) board voted to deny me my seat although neither the WMNA Constitution nor the by-laws give them that authority.

I chose to seek a seat on the board in the last election at the urging of the current board president. He did so at a meeting he requested with me to discuss something “weird” the outgoing president told him following the October 8, 2018 board meeting. That was that there were more seats available than candidates and the outgoing president was concerned that I might publicly declared my candidacy in which case he and/or other board members would have to run to try to keep me off the board.

The current board president, who by Oct.8, 2018 had already declared an interest in being on the board, was told by the outgoing president that since there were more seats than candidates he (the current president) was certain to be elected with a single vote, since a single vote was all the rules required.

Roberts’ Rules of Order, which the WMNA Constitution says meetings are governed by in Article IV, states “If the vote is taken by ballot, there is always the opportunity to write in a name. In this case, a person can win as a write-in candidate without ever being nominated.” That is how WMNA board elections always happened until AFTER last years election when a retroactive rule change was made.

Since 2012 it has been clearly stated in writing in advance of board elections that write-ins were encouraged.

The WMNA webpage announcing last years elections says “Regarding the upcoming election of the Woolen Mills Neighborhood Association Board, accepting and counting of ballots will be informed by Code of Virginia governing voting process.”

Code of Virginia § 24.2-644.C. says “At all elections except primary elections it is lawful for any voter to vote for any person other than the listed candidates for the office by writing or hand printing the person’s name on the official ballot.”

As a legal write in candidate with 2 votes I was elected to a seat on the WMNA board last October. Members of the outgoing and the current board collaborated in a blatant violation of not only the organization’s rules, but of common decency and fair play to deny me that seat.

Further, the WMNA Constitution calls for elections every 2 years. We had an election last year. What’s up with that?

If the WMNA is to survive, a lot must change. I plan to be an agent of change.
